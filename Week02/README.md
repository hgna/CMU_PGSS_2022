Lecture 3 Notes
- How can we convert text to numbers?
- Natural language processing: classification and regression, also has matching, rankings and retrieval
- matching: classify something and match them to another category
- transformers turn an unstructured language specific comparative task into a distance comparative task
- any point in space can be defined by an eigen vector (x, y, z) with (0,0,1) etc.
- use distance formula to find distance: root (a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2 + (c-z)^2 
- neural information retrieval: using neural networks to transform every piece of text into a unique coordinate in the space
- 768 dimensional space used by Google
- Distance between text can be representative of similarities between the text!!!
